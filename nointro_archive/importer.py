"""Turn `<directory>/<file>` into a FetchPlan.

The plugin decides *what* to fetch and nothing else: `ctx.http` is an RPC
back to the host, and the host re-validates every URL in the returned plan
against this plugin's manifest allowlist before fetching any of it --
including each hop of the redirect Archive.org answers with, which is why
`*.archive.org` is declared alongside `archive.org`.

Three decisions here are load-bearing:

**The file is confirmed to exist in the index, not assumed.** A URL could
be built from the source id by string concatenation alone, and it would be
wrong the moment a set is rebuilt and a file renamed -- the host would
fetch the mirror's 404 page, hash it, upload it, and report DONE. So the
directory index is read (from the cache the search already filled, usually
at no cost) and the entry is matched by name. No entry, no plan.

**The URL is built from the index's own href, not from the name.** Mirrors
percent-encode differently, and a name round-tripped through a guess at
encoding is a name that sometimes 404s. The href is what the server said.

**The platform comes from the directory, and is never guessed.** See
platforms.py.
